# Eaglesight-master

This repo contains 2 packages:

- `master` is really the core. Though it needs to be started by a manager, it will provide all the HTTP endpoints for `Eaglesight-frontend` to function correctly.

- `demo-manager` is the developement manager. It is not indented to run in production. Its only reason to exists is to provide an example implementation of a _slave manager_.
